# Issue 101902

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101902

Interesting and a small issue / a simple issue. At least in my eyes ðŸ™ˆ

Someone even pointed out the code related to the issue

I'm wondering if this is really expected or unexpected. Seems unexpected, given that some people have noted this and not ignored / commented / closed the issue saying it's expected.

The version is v1.19 ! Looks like many didn't notice it? I don't know. Or maybe it's fixed in other versions? Gotta check

Actions:
- Check the kubelet /stats/summary API
    - In v1.19
    - In latest stable version
- Check the code
    - In v1.19
    - In latest stable version
- Think about what's the possible solution here based on the code
