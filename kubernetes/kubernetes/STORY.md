# Story

I'm currently looking for issues in the Kubernetes GitHub repo as of May 11th 2021

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/

I was thinking about looking for the latest releases and checkout issues or maybe even run the latest releases and try things and see how it works or if there are any issues

I have kind of done this kind of thing before - where I get started very slowly - by first becoming a user, a reporter, a tester and then a developer

User - specifically using latest versions, or alpha / beta / developer preview / release candidate versions.

Reporter - Reporting issues

Tester - Trying out and kind of testing new features, to report issues

Developer - Write code to fix issues / develop new features

Of course there's documentation in between and then lot of other ways to contribute to Open Source too - documentation, talks, mentoring others to contribute to OSS etc

Latest release candidate as of now is - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.22.0-alpha.1

Just bugs -
