When I have directories with exactly one directory
in each of them and then a file, the hover over the
directory does NOT work. Hmm.

For example

microsoft
|
- vscode
  |
  - yet-to-be-reported
    |
    - file-explorer-issue-file

I can't hover over microsoft or vs code properly when the explorer size is
small. I have to hover over the path separator, the slash, and then the
underline on the directory shows up and then I can click on it. Weird.

This clearly happens only when the file explorer size is small
and is cutting some parts of the whole path which is too big, and hence it shows
dot (...), the ellipsis or something.
