I have cloned the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo repo

I think only golang files need to be checked, as profefe
is only for golang applications

The golang services in the repo are
* checkoutservice
* frontend
* shippingservice
* productcatalogservice

All of them use stackdriver agent and the task is to replace that with 
profefe agent according to this issue
